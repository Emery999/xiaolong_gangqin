His constructive feedback and gentle instruction have encouraged her to develop her piano skills. He takes the time to understand her learning style to keep her engaged and his ability to break down complex concepts into manageable steps has made a significant difference in her progress. I highly recommend Collin to anyone looking for a dedicated and inspiring piano instructor!",

Within just a few weeks, Collin's gentle guidance, remarkable patience, and keen ability to recognize and nurture talent had already sparked a genuine interest in my son. It was clear that Collin wasn't just teaching notes and keys‚Äîhe was instilling a love for music. Collin is a man of few words, but his presence speaks volumes. His quiet confidence, deep musical talent, and unwavering dedication to his students create an environment where children feel both supported and inspired. My son quickly grew fond of his classes and looked forward to every session with enthusiasm and joy. We couldn't have asked for a better teacher to introduce my son to the world of piano. Collin has laid a beautiful foundation for his musical journey, and for that, we are deeply grateful.",

        "text": "My two daughters's experience being tutored by Collin has been life-changing. He gently led them to appreciate, understand and love music, to the extent that my younger daughter is now a serious competitive player, all from her own passion for the piano. They looked forward to every session. They also grew tremendously on the academic side from Collin's expert insights on reading comprehension and interest in English literature. My older daughter now excels in the English language and enjoys high level English literature. The most impressive thing to me as a parent was Collin's incredibly empathic, deeply sensitive and caring approach to each of them as an individual. I've never seen a more gifted teacher in any subject ever. Collin's style is amazing and unique. He's the \"Mr. Rogers\" of both music and English teaching!",
